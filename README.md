# Numpy-SVM: A Beginner's Guide to Support Vector Machines from Scratch

Welcome to Numpy-SVM, a comprehensive exploration into building a Support Vector Machine (SVM) from the ground up using Python and the powerful numerical computing library, NumPy. This project serves as an educational resource for beginners, providing a clear understanding of the inner workings of SVMs through hands-on implementation and detailed mathematical explanations.

## Features:

1. **Iris Dataset:** The project is based on the classic Iris dataset, offering a well-known and easily understandable dataset for beginners to apply SVM.

2. **From Scratch Implementation:** Dive deep into the mathematics behind SVM by implementing the core components, including the optimization of weight vectors (w) and the bias term (b) using gradient descent.

3. **NumPy Integration:** Leverage the capabilities of NumPy for efficient numerical computations, allowing for a streamlined and readable codebase.

4. **Educational Resource:** The project is designed as a learning tool, providing detailed comments and explanations throughout the code to help users grasp the key concepts behind SVMs.

5. **Step-by-Step Guide:** Follow a step-by-step guide to understand each phase of SVM implementation, from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation.

6. **Visualizations:** Gain insights into the SVM decision boundary and support vectors through visualizations, enhancing the learning experience.

7. **Optimization Techniques:** Explore various optimization techniques for SVM, including gradient descent, to fine-tune the model parameters for better performance.

8. **Documentation:** Comprehensive documentation is provided to guide users through the code, making it accessible for individuals new to machine learning and SVMs.
